# The essential stuff
# What is essential?
#  - Tiny background services that don't add much res-usage but prove to be very useful
#  - Services that apps need to run properly
#  - System-internal things that do their job in the background
#  - Packages for hardware that most devices have (for ex bluetooth is on by default. but the laptop might not have it, so it's a feature)
